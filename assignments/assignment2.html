      <i>Peeps is a group that posts a daily diary and nightly open thread for animal lovers. We share photos, seek & give advice about pet health and behavior issues, support each other in times of sadness and stress, celebrate together when times are good, and on most days have an inordinate amount of fun.

      <b>Working is still frustratingly out of the question, and the wheels of government assistance grind very slowly (though they may at last actually be grinding!), but Sara has begun receiving Social Security this month and is now on Medicare, so things may be changing for the better, though I expect that some help will still be needed.  Those who can and would like to help can always use this PayPal link, which can also be found in the diary by Angela Marx that is linked from the preceding comment.</b>

      This was a fleece onesie that I sewed up when my cat <b>Tiger</b> kept popping new mast cell tumors on his skin as fast as the vet could take them off… so we agreed to shave him and see how many more were starting.  There were hundreds.  The good news is that the cancer was treatable with very inexpensive meds ($8/3 month supply) and the meds kept him well for quite a few more years.  And we stopped trying to remove all the little tumors… and he wore his Tiger Suit (with dignity!  unlike poor Shaman) until his fur grew back, which only took a couple months.
